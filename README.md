This repository is a playground for implementing algorithms that are personally of interest to me.
Most of them cover topics in Graph Theory.

Completed:
1) Blossom algorithm for computing a Maximum Matching in an undirected graph
2) Sieve of eratosthenes for generating primes, using the prime number theorem
   and newton's method to approximate the upper bound for the sieve.
   Largest sieve so far generates 10,000,000 primes in 3-5 seconds.
3) Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for computing max flow in a network
